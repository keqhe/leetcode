1) set, multiset, unordered_set
2) map (==java TreeMap?), unordered_map(==java HashMap?), multimap?
The map and the multimap are both containers that manage key/value pairs as single components. 
The essential difference between the two is that in a map the keys must be unique, 
while a multimap permits duplicate keys. 
In both containers, the sort order of components is the sort order of the keys, 
with the values corresponding to keys determining the order for duplicate keys in a multimap. 

3) priority queue
4) list
5) vector
6) pair
